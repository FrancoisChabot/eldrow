# How this works:

# The solver is built of two primary components

# 1. The simplifier
# The simplifier takes a list of workspaces (one for each guess), and tries to
# identify the smallest subset of possible words each guess can possibly have.
#
# However, a typical wordle solve will often have between 1 and 1000 possible
# words for each guess, even when simplified as much as possible. This means
# there are regularly millions of valid inputs that would have led to a given
# solution layout. This leads us to component #2
#
# 2. The searcher
# The searcher visits the graph of possible answers while priorizing
# "high-likelyhood" words, as defined in the companion "words_scored.txt" file.
# That file was pre-baked by combining
# - The list of acceptable words (extracted from wordle's javascript code)
# - A publickly available word/frequncy dataset.
# - Some manual heuristics (such as penalizing words with repeated letters)


# Loads a file containing accepted words (extracted from wordle's javascript)
# Each word has a score associated with it.
# For the file in the repo, the value was computed based on the
# word frequency with a negative bias for repeated letters
def load_words(fname):
    scores = {}
    with open(fname, "r") as file:
        for line in file.readlines():
            w, c = line.strip().split(" ")
            scores[w] = float(c)

    words = list(scores.keys())

    # Words are always sorted by highest to lowest score everywhere
    words.sort(key=lambda x: -scores[x])
    return words, scores
